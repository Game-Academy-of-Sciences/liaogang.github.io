##MusicBrainz Identifier
https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier

One of MusicBrainz' aims is to be the universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous form of music identification; this music identification is performed through the use of MusicBrainz Identifiers (MBIDs).

In a nutshell, an MBID is a 36 character Universally Unique Identifier that is permanently assigned to each entity in the database, i.e. artists, release groups, releases, recordings, works, labels, areas, places and URLs. MBIDs are also assigned to Tracks, though tracks do not share many other properties of entities. For example, the artist Queen has an artist MBID of 0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3, and their song Bohemian Rhapsody has a recording MBID of ebf79ba5-085e-48d2-9eb8-2d992fbf0f6d.

An entity can have more than one MBID. When an entity is merged into another, its MBIDs redirect to the other entity.
