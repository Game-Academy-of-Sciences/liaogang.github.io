The world is changed.  

I feel it in the water.  

I feel it in the earth.  

I smell it in the air.  

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.  

It began with the forging of the Great Rings.  

Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.  

Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.  

And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men, who, above all else, desire power.  

But they were, all of them, deceived, for another Ring was made.  

In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ring, to control all others.  

And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.  

One Ring to rule them all.  

One by one, the free peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring.  

But there were some who resisted.  

A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth.  

Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone.  

It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.  

And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated.  

The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted.  

And the ring of power has a will of its own.  

It betrayed Isildur, to his death.  

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.  

History became legend.  

Legend became myth.  

And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge.  

Until, when chance came, the ring ensnared another bearer.  

The ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels under the Misty Mountains, and there it consumed him.  

The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life.
