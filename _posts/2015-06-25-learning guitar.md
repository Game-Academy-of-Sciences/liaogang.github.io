To prevent your fret hand from injury, keep your calluses in check.  
为了防止你按弦的手受伤，经常检查你的老茧。

Take a buffer board to your fingertips once or twice a week.  
在指尖上带上（胶带？）每周一或两次。
 
Buffing and filing your calluses IS important.  
抛光和整理你的老茧很重要。
 
Over time the outermost layer of skin will begin to peel.  
随着时间的推移皮肤最外面一层会开始脱落。  
 
It's imperative at that time to buff the callous smooth, or you risk getting a string caught in an open groove of your callous when changing chords.  
那时抛光处理老茧是必不可少的，否则你换弦时老茧的开槽处可能把琴弦粘起。
