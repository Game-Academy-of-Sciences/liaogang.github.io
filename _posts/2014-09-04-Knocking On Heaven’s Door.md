[Knocking On Heaven’s Door - by Bob Dylan](/resource/music/敲开天堂之门_Knocking_On_Heaven’s_Door_群星_韩剧恋人_(香港版).mp3)


Mama take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see  
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door  

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  

Mama put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is comin' down  
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door  

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
