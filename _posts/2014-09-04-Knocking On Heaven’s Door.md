[Knocking On Heaven’s Door - by Bob Dylan](/resource/music/敲开天堂之门_Knocking_On_Heaven’s_Door_群星_韩剧恋人_(香港版).mp3)


Mama take this badge from me  
I cant use it anymore  
Its getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like Im knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door 

Mama put my guns in the ground  
I cant shoot them anymore  
That long cold black cloud is comin down  
Feels like Im knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door
